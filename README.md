# Spoonfed File infector

Spoonfed is the name of the file infector for x86 arch I wrote as PoC.

It uses post-pending technique for the infection. 

I only tested it on Win7x86 and Win10x86 (In some types of PE it doesn't work). 

Probably there are better ways for writting it, but it is my first FI.

Any suggestion @D00RT_RM or pull request!

Enjoy!
